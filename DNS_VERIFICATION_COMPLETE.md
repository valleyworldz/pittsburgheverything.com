# ✅ DNS TXT Record Added Successfully!

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **DNS RECORD CREATED**

---

## ✅ What Was Done

I successfully added the Google Search Console verification TXT record to your Vercel DNS:

**DNS Record Details:**
- **Type:** TXT
- **Name:** @ (root domain)
- **Value:** `google-site-verification=hPFeJhF-yg2ZIX_YHJ95h0ZkxtVn1IlUeUssncEcXXI`
- **TTL:** 60 seconds
- **Comment:** Google Search Console verification
- **Status:** ✅ Created successfully

**Location:** Vercel DNS Management  
**URL:** https://vercel.com/valleytainment/~/domains/pittsburgheverything.com

---

## ⏳ Next Steps

### Step 1: Wait for DNS Propagation (5-30 minutes)

DNS changes take time to propagate across the internet. Google needs to be able to see this TXT record before verification will work.

**Typical wait times:**
- **Minimum:** 5-10 minutes
- **Average:** 15-30 minutes
- **Maximum:** Up to 24 hours (rare)

### Step 2: Verify in Google Search Console

Once DNS has propagated (wait at least 10-15 minutes), go back to Google Search Console:

1. **Go to:** https://search.google.com/search-console
2. **Select your property:** `pittsburgheverything.com`
3. **Click "Verify"** (or "Re-verify" if you tried before)
4. **Choose "Domain name provider"** method
5. **Click "Verify"**

Google will check for the TXT record and verify ownership!
