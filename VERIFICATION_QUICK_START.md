## 🔧 Method 2: DNS TXT Record

If you prefer DNS or HTML doesn't work:

### Your DNS Record:
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: google-site-verification=hPFeJhF-yg2ZIX_YHJ95h0ZkxtVn1IlUeUssncEcXXI
```

### Quick Steps:
1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Go to DNS Management
3. Add the TXT record above
4. Wait 5-30 minutes
5. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console
