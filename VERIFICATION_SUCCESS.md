## 🚀 Next Steps - Maximize Your SEO

Now that you're verified, here's what to do:

### 1. Submit Your Sitemap (Priority: HIGH)

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Select: `pittsburgheverything.com`
3. Click: **Sitemaps** (left sidebar)
4. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
5. Click: **Submit**

**Your sitemap URL:** `https://pittsburgheverything.com/sitemap.xml`

This tells Google about all your pages and helps them get indexed faster!

### 2. Request Indexing for Key Pages

Use the **URL Inspection** tool to request indexing for important pages:

1. Go to: **URL Inspection** (left sidebar)
2. Enter URLs like:
   - `https://pittsburgheverything.com`
   - `https://pittsburgheverything.com/restaurants`
   - `https://pittsburgheverything.com/events`
   - `https://pittsburgheverything.com/deals`
3. Click: **Request Indexing**

### 3. Set Up Email Alerts

1. Go to: **Settings** → **Users and permissions**
2. Add email alerts for:
   - Coverage issues
   - Security issues
   - Manual actions
   - Mobile usability

## 🔐 Backup Verification (Optional but Recommended)

Google suggests adding multiple verification methods. You already have the HTML meta tag in your code!

**To add HTML tag verification as backup:**
1. Go to: **Settings** → **Ownership verification**
2. Click: **Add a verification method**
3. Choose: **HTML tag**
4. Copy the code shown (should be the same: `hPFeJhF-yg2ZIX_YHJ95h0ZkxtVn1IlUeUssncEcXXI`)
5. The meta tag is already in your `app/layout.tsx` - it should auto-verify!

This gives you redundancy in case DNS changes.
