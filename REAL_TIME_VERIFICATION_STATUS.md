# 🔍 Real-Time Verification Status

## ✅ Current Status Check

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Site:** https://pittsburgheverything.com

### What I Found:

1. ✅ **Meta Tag Present:** Your site has a Google verification meta tag
2. ⚠️ **Wrong Code:** Currently shows placeholder `your-google-site-verification`
3. ✅ **Code Updated:** I've updated your code with the real verification code
4. ⏳ **Needs Deployment:** Site needs to be deployed with latest code

## 🎯 Action Plan

### Step 1: Deploy Your Code (REQUIRED)

Your code has the verification code, but it's not live yet. Deploy it:

```bash
# In your terminal:
cd /Users/valleytainmentgmail.com/Desktop/PittsburghEverything.com
git add .
git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification code"
git push
```

**Or if using Vercel:**
- The code will auto-deploy when you push
- Or manually trigger deployment in Vercel dashboard

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

- Usually takes 1-3 minutes
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status

### Step 3: Verify Meta Tag is Live

Once deployed, the meta tag should show:
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="hPFeJhF-yg2ZIX_YHJ95h0ZkxtVn1IlUeUssncEcXXI" />
```

### Step 4: Verify in Google Search Console

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Sign in (I'll wait for you to sign in)
3. Add property: `https://pittsburgheverything.com`
4. Choose "HTML tag" method
5. Click "Verify"
